            <p>Nick Woodman created the first model of the GoPro camera that was released in 2004, named the Hero 35mm. Before this camera, there weren't any devices that could record films and videos while being completely waterproof. Nick Woodman wanted to solve this problem: he came up with a prototype that consisted of a waterproof camera that could be mounted on a strap around the wrist. Eventually, with the help of a Chinese camera company, he was able to produce the first camera that could withstand the extreme conditions of sports such as surfing.
