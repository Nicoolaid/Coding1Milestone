        <p class="content">The first polaroid camera, named the Model 95, was invented by Edwin H. Land in 1948. At the time, it only produced sepia-toned photographs. In order to view a photo, the photographer had to wait 60 seconds after taking a photo before peeling off the top film to fully see the image. This camera is known to be the stepping stone to instant photography.</p>

        <p class="content">The first compact digital camera was created by Fujifilm in 1988 with the name of FUJIX DS-1F. Storing its data through a memory card, the digital camera was able to produce completely digital images. This innovation sparked many other digital cameras to be made, each building onto the original model.

        <p class="content">Kodak DCS 100, the first DSLR camera, was launched by Kodak in 1991. This camera included a reworked Nikon F3 SLR body with a customized drive unit, along with a storage unit that connects to the camera through cable so data can be stored externally.

        <p class="content">The first camera phone is believed to be Japanâ€™s Kyocera VP-210 launched in May 1999. With a 0.11MP camera and a storage capacity of 20 pictures, this device became the first mobile phone that had a built-in camera. It even came with a stand for users to take photos of themselves efficiently.

        <p class="content">Nick Woodman created the first model of the GoPro camera that was released in 2004, named the Hero 35mm. Before this camera, there weren't any devices that could record films and videos while being completely waterproof. Nick Woodman wanted to solve this problem: he came up with a prototype that consisted of a waterproof camera that could be mounted on a strap around the wrist. Eventually, with the help of a Chinese camera company, he was able to produce the first camera that could withstand the extreme conditions of sports such as surfing.
